## TGraphErrors fit
 以下在[链接](https://root.cern/doc/v618/TGraph_8cxx_source.html)的代码1165行
 ///
 ///   In case of a TGraphErrors object, when x errors are present, the error along x,
 ///   is projected along the y-direction by calculating the function at the points x-exlow and
 ///   x+exhigh. The chisquare is then computed as the sum of the quantity below at each point:
 ///
 /// \f[
 ///   \frac{(y-f(x))^{2}}{ey^{2}+(\frac{1}{2}(exl+exh)f'(x))^{2}}
 /// \f]
 ///
 ///   where x and y are the point coordinates, and f'(x) is the derivative of the
 ///   function f(x).
