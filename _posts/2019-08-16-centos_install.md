## use minimal iso

the iso url is http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso

it was a stupid choice which took me about 5 hours to wait the source installation verified and failed at last.

## use dvd iso

the iso file size is about 4.3GB.([url](http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/centos/7.6.1810/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso))

must use the ultraiso or other tools to write the iso into the U-disk.

+ Do not use the windows file explorer, just copy make no sense.
+ should assign the disk first
+ when creating the user(not root), if you add group and then check the administator, installation will give a bug and you only restart and do all things again.
